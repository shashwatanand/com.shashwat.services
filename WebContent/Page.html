		<h1>Synchronous Calls</h1>
		<p>These calls won't return until the response is received from the server.</p>
		<p>Since javascript runs on the UI thread this means that the rest of the browser can't be interacted with until the response is received.</p>
		<h2>getAllDtcResults</h2>
		<p>This function takes around 10 seconds to run. Due to being synced, this will lock the UI.</p>
		<input type="button" onclick="onClick_getAllDtcResultsSync()" value="getAllDtcResults">
		<h3>Output:</h3>
		<p>Return value: <span id="getAllDtcResultsSyncOutput"></span></p>
		<h2>getConnectedVci</h2>
		<p>This will also lock however it returns as soon as the server has finished with the request. Around <50ms</p>
		<input type="button" onclick="onClick_getConnectedVciSync()" value="getConnectedVci">
		<h3>Output:</h3>
		<p>Return value: <span id="getConnectedVciSyncOutput"></span></p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h1>Asynchronous Calls</h1>
		<p>These calls will return immediately after the request is sent.</p>
		<p>This means that any information that the asynchronous call receives cannot be returned in the function it was called in.<p>
		<p>However this no longer locks the UI.</p>
		<h2>getAllDtcResults</h2>
		<p>This function takes around 10 seconds to run. Due to being asynced and utilising promises there is no locking of the UI.</p>
		<input type="button" onclick="onClick_getAllDtcResults()" value="getAllDtcResults">
		<h3>Output:</h3>
		<p>Result: <span id="getAllDtcResultsOutput"></span></p>
		<h2>getConnectedVci</h2>
		<p>This will also not lock it utilises the promise as soon as the server has finished with the request. Around <50ms</p>
		<input type="button" onclick="onClick_getConnectedVci()" value="getConnectedVci">
		<h3>Output:</h3>
		<p>Result: <span id="getConnectedVciOutput"></span></p>
